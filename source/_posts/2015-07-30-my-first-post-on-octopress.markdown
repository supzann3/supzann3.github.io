Have you ever wonder what are the differences among Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Computer Engineering?

Computer Science
Computer science is a branch of mathematics and theoretical major. Computer science focuses on programming and the theory behind it. Most people holding this major end up with programming jobs same as a software engineering, for the reason that a computer science education program likely contains a lot of software engineering classes.  It deals more with the nature of information of computations, It should be called “computing science” instead of computer science. A computer science told me once that they could finish their major based on paper and pencil. 
I would say the difference between software engineering and computer science would be like doing construction work and figuring out what a house is.

Software Engineering 
Software engineering focuses on designing and building software. Mostly concentrated in the application of writing computer programs.  In my opinion this is more focused around developing, deploying, and documenting user-friendly software. Software engineers are trained in all aspects of the software life cycle, from analysis to how to efficiently test and validate software. Just like computer engineering, software engineering involves a lot of hands on.  Since the major’s heart is to design and build software in teams, many programs have incorporated classes that evolve communication skills, management skills, and working with nontechnical people skills. 

Computer Engineering would be like if electrical engineering and computer science had a baby together. The concepts covered the design of computer software and hardware. In contrast with the other two majors, computer engineering focuses in the design and build of a computer with software emphasis on the hardware such as drivers, and operating systems. There is more hands on, in which people learn more about circuits, logic, physics, and programming.
